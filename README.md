I always aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning concepts by reading and analyzing key machine learning papers. However, I make sure to implement these concepts in code as well. I find this approach gives me a stronger grasp of the topic and provides a tangible application. Understanding the math can only take you so far, but the real understanding comes through applying it.
